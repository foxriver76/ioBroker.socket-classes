# @iobroker/socket-classes

This library is used for following adapters:
- [iobroker.admin](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.admin)
- [iobroker.cloud](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.cloud)
- [iobroker.socketio](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.socketio)
- [iobroker.ws](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.ws)
- [iobroker.rest-api](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.rest-api)
- [iobroker.iot](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.iot)

## Usage as admin
```
const TTL_SEC      = 3600;

const SocketAdmin  = require('@iobroker/socket-classes').SocketAdmin;
const ws           = require('@iobroker/ws-server');
const session      = require('express-session');
const utils 	   = require('@iobroker/adapter-core'); // Get common adapter utils
const AdapterStore = require(utils.controllerDir + '/lib/session.js')(session, TTL_SEC);

const store = new AdapterStore({adapter});

const io = new SocketAdmin(adapter.config, adapter, objects);
io.start(
    server,
    ws,
    {
        userKey: 'connect.sid',
        store,
        secret: adapter.config.secret
    }
);

// subscribe on all object changes
io.subscribe('objectChange', '*');


// later
io.close();
```

## Usage as socket (ws or socketio)
```
const TTL_SEC      = 3600;

const ws           = require('@iobroker/ws-server');
const SocketWS     = require('@iobroker/socket-classes').SocketCommon;
const session      = require('express-session');
const utils 	   = require('@iobroker/adapter-core'); // Get common adapter utils
const AdapterStore = require(utils.controllerDir + '/lib/session.js')(session, TTL_SEC);

const store = new AdapterStore({adapter});

const settings = adapter.config;
settings.crossDomain = true;
settings.ttl = settings.ttl || TTL_SEC;

const io = new SocketWS(settings, adapter);
io.start(server.server, ws, {userKey: 'connect.sid', checkUser, store, secret: adapter.config.secret});


// later
io.close();
```
